TwitterSample
-------------

This sample illustrates how to write a simple twitter client using HttpClient. The sample uses a 
HttpMessageHandler to insert the appropriate OAuth authentication information into the outgoing
HttpRequestMessage. The result from twitter is read using JSON.NET as a JToken.

Before you can run this sample you must obtain an application key from twitter, and 
fill in the information in the OAuthMessageHandler class, see 
http://dev.twitter.com/ for details.
