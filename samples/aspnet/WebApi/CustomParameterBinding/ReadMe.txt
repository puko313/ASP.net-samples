CustomParameterBindingSample
----------------------------

This ASP.NET Web API sample illustrates how to customize the parameter binding process which is 
the process that determines how information from a request is bound to action parameters.

In this sample, the Home controller has four actions: 

1. BindPrincipal shows how to bind an IPrincipal parameter from a custom generic principal, 
   not from an HTTP GET message;

2. BindCustomComplexTypeFromUriOrBody shows how to bind a Complex Type parameter which could 
   come from either the message body or request Uri of an HTTP POST message;

3. BindCustomComplexTypeFromUriWithRenamedProperty shows how to bind a Complex Type parameter 
   with a renamed property which comes from request Uri of an HTTP POST message; 

4. PostMultipleParametersFromBody shows how to bind multiple parameters from body for a POST message;
