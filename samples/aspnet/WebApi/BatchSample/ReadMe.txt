BatchSample
-----------------

This sample shows how to use request batching in Web API 2. Batching is a Web API 
feature that allows a customer to pack several API requests and send them to the Web API
service in one HTTP request and receive a single HTTP response with the response to all
their requests. This way, the client can optimize calls to the server and improve the 
latency and scalability of its service.
