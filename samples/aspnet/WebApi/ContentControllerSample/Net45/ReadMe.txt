ContentControllerSample
-----------------------

This ASP.NET Web API sample illustrates how to read and write request and response entities 
asynchronously using streams. The sample controller has two actions: a PUT action which 
reads the request entity body asynchronously and stores it in a local file and a GET 
action which returns the content of the local file.
